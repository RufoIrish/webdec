On 21 February 1899, the USS Petrel (PG-2) deployed a landing party of 40 marines on the shores of Cebu.[15] Cebu's transfer to the Commonwealth government was signed by Luis Flores although others, most notably General Arcadio Maxilom and Juan Climaco, offered resistance until 1901.[16] Governor W. H. Taft visited Cebu on 17 April 1901, and appointed Julio Llorento as the first provincial governor.[17] Juan Climaco was elected to that office in January 1904.<br>Along with the rest of the country, Cebu came under Japanese occupation during WWII. The Japanese encountered some opposition there from guerrillas and irregular forces led by Col. James Cushing and the Cebu Area Command. It was finally liberated with the Battle for Cebu City in March and April 1945. The military general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 8th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary, active from 3 January 1942 to 30 June 1946, was stationed in Cebu City during World War II","result":2.9999217975419015}
